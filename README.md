# IA2 Learning Environment

## Principle of the Game and Usage

This is a simple 1D game where the player, represented as the "bird", must follow a red ball. The closer the player is to the ball, the more points they score. The main idea behind this game is to collect data from the controller and the game environment to build a machine learning (ML) algorithm that learns to assist the user in 1D mouse displacement.

## Usage

- **Start the game**: Press **"s"** to start.
- **Pause the game**: Press **"s"** to pause.
- **End the game**: Once paused, press **"e"** to end.
- **Restart the game**: In the ended mode, press **"r"** to restart.

## Requirements
To set up the learning environment, ensure you have the following:
- Rust: Version 1.81.0
  - Follow the installation instructions from the official Rust page: Rust Installation Guide
-Bevy: Version 0.9.0
  - Follow the setup guide for Bevy from the official site: Bevy Quick Start Guide
